            " Unterscheidung zwischen \"New York City\" und \"New York State\" New York City is the most populous city in the United States and is located in the southeastern state of New York. The city is named after the Duke of York, who was King of England from 1660 to 1685. In 1664, the English Parliament granted the Duke a charter to establish a colony in North America, which he named New York in honor of his title. The name \"New York\" is derived from the Dutch name \"Nieuw Amsterdam,\" which was the name of a Dutch settlement established in 1626 on the southern tip of Manhattan Island. The Dutch name is thought to be a combination of the Dutch words \"nieu\" (meaning \"new\") and \"amsterdam\" (meaning \"dam in the river\"). When the English took control of the colony in 1664, they renamed it \"New York\" to distinguish it from the original Dutch settlement. Over time, the name \"New York City\" came to be used to refer to the entire metropolitan area, including the five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx\n"
